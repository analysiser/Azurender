Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Azurender (I just like the word azure out of no reason...)

Azurender is a raytracer based on project 3 of CMU's computer graphics class 
(15-462). (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15462-f13/www/)

It currently has the option for direct illumination, global illumination based 
on a simple (fake) version of path-tracing (which is also used by
some commercial renderer of some studio :) ), and photon mapping. It could render
diffusive, transmissive and specular reflective surfaces, with incomplete texture 
mapping (limitations of 15-462 starter code and I'm working on a complete recon-
struction on framwork...). It supports environment mapping based on cube mapping 
(The function still need to improve). It supports depth of field.

It has acceleration data structures for photon mapping (KD-Tree) and ray tracing
(BVH Tree). For KD-Tree buidling and nearest neighbor searching, my final project
in Parallel Computer Architecture and Programming (15-418, by Kavon Fatahalian:
http://15418.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2014/) final project has more detailed description
(http://cargocollective.com/xiaoli/15418-Final-Project).

NOTE:
For 15-462 students in CMU, some implementation might be helpful to your project,
but please learn by yourself first, Shirley's book and PBRT are good resources. 
NEVER just copy the code.
PBRT: (www.pbrt.org)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building the Code
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project uses the CMake build system (www.cmake.org). CMake is a kind of
"meta build-system," in that it creates a build system for you. It supports
many different build systems, ranging from Unix Makefiles to Visual Studio
projects to XCode projects.

1) If you don't have CMake installed, you should install it. If you're running
    Linux, it should be available through your disto's package manager
    (apt-get, pacman, ports, etc). Windows and OSX installers can be downloaded
    from http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
2) Open up a command prompt in the "build" directory and run "cmake ../src".
    CMake will generate the build system in the build directory. By default,
    CMake will generate Makefiles on Linux and OSX and a Visual Studio project
    on Windows. If you'd like to change that, you can pass a different
    "generator" to cmake with the -G flag. A full list of generators can be
    found at the bottom of the output generated by running "cmake". For
    example, "cmake -G 'Xcode' ../src" will generate an Xcode project on OSX.

Additional notes for MAC users (since I'm using MAC myself...):
You could use Homebrew to get required libraries, get it from (http://brew.sh/)
Use homebrew to install glew, libpng, sdl and cmake. call 'brew install XXX'
in terminal.


For debugging, use the following CMake command:

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../src

for tracing images (especially if you have global illumination and/or a distributed ray tracer) 
use the following CMake command: (Which I don't think would be useful at all...)

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../src

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the Program
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

raytracer [-r] [-d width height] input_scene [output_file]

Options:

    -r:
        Raytraces the scene and saves to the output file without
        loading a window or creating an opengl context.
    -d width height
        The dimensions of image to raytrace (and window if usingg
        and opengl context. Defaults to width=800, height=600.
    input_scene:
        The scene file to load and raytrace.
    output_file:
        The output file in which to write the rendered images.
        If not specified, default timestamped filenames are used.

Instructions:

    Press 'r' to raytrace the scene. Press 'r' again to go back to
    go back to OpenGL rendering. Press 'f' to dump the most recently
    raytraced image to the output file.

    Use the mouse and 'w', 'a', 's', 'd', 'q', and 'e' to move the
    camera around. The keys translate the camera, and left and right
    mouse buttons rotate the camera.

    If not using windowed mode (i.e., -r was specified), then output
    image will be automatically generated and the program will exit.


Note for MAC users:
Xcode would build the executable file under build/raytracer/debug. Copy everything 
in /resources to /debug file, then you can set arguments by editing scheme in
Xcode.

C++ Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Originally) For the sake of simpler math routines and data structures, the code uses
C++ over straight C. The code tries to stay away from most features of the
language to keep it as simple as possible. This project attempts to break
you into C++ easily.

(Xiao's note )I implemented the BVH Tree with more C++ 11 features, including 
template based function object and lambda expression. It is still very simple and straight 
forward but it (might) looks weird. It's a good thing to have C++ become more like
a modern language.
